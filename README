 Script Name: HTML Quiz Reader
 Description: A Javascript/jQuery reader to power HTML quizzes in the new PD quiz format
      Author: Josh Renaud
     Version: 0.2e
        Date: 2012-10-29
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This script expects some JS variables to be included in the individual quiz's HTML file.
 These variables are generated by the Quiz Converter (XML -> HTML) or the HTML Quiz Maker.
		totalQuestions
		scoringRange[]
		scoringEvaluation[]

 These variables are optional. Set them to true to activate features:
      randomTrueFalse  --  Causes t/f answers to be randomized (useful w/ custom labels)
      hasFlash         --  (to be supported in a future version)

 These HTML classes are optional for each question, and enable special effects:
      .effect-dissolve   --  Dissolves FG image into a different BG image on answer
      .transition-scroll --  Scroll FG from one x,y position to another on answer
      .transition-bg     --  Adds BG image (name in form 00b-fade.jpg). Use with transparent FG img.

 CHANGELOG

 2012-10-29-- v0.2e
 "Transitions" are becoming "Effects." What was called "Fade" is now more accurately called "Dissolve,"
 and it is implemented in quizMaker. quizReader has been updated to work with the Dissolve Effect.
 The other transitions will slowly be implemented in quizMaker, but probably will keep their names.


 2012-04-02-- v0.2d
 Updated some routines to eliminate the need for the quesType[] array. All the questions had
 classes already, so this array was redundant.


 2012-03-05-- v0.2c
 Updated the Scroll routines to allow more granular control. Now you can specify in HTML these
 attributes: xScrollFrom, yScrollFrom, xScrollTo, yScrollTo. These are coordinates in terms of
 the image's upper left corner. All are optional. 

 The script assumes (if nothing is specified) that the image will start at position 0,0 
 (top: 0, left: 0). It also assumes (if nothing is specified) that the image will scroll to 
 the offset between the image's height and a normal height (358), and the offset between the 
 image's width and a normal width (600).


 2012-02-23-- v0.2b
 Changing the judgment screen to include a "Share your score on Facebook / Twitter feature"


 2012-02-14-- v0.2a
 Adding class that allows for background image. For now, background must be in form: 00b-fade.jpg
 .transition-bg
 
 Also adding support for randomized true/false answers. Normally you wouldn't want this,
 but if you use custom labels for True/False (as in the Mardi Gras masks quiz), you might.
 This is triggered adding var randomTrueFalse = "true";


 2012-02-06 -- v0.2
 Adding support for question transitions including:
 * FADE:   Adds a background images to div.photos, then fades the foreground image(s) 
           when question is answered
 * SCROLL: Scrolls the foreground image from one side to another (top to bottom, left to right, etc)
 
 These transitions are indicated by adding classes to the question's div.questions:
 .transition-fade or .transition-scroll

 Transitions are not yet implemented in QuizMaker and have to be created by hand.
